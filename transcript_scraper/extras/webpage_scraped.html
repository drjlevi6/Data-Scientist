The first thing we want to do is make sure    that you have installed Beautiful Soup    and you would do that through the Anaconda command line.    I showed you how to do that in section 6.1.    So in this case we have already installed Beautiful Soup    and then we just want to check to make sure    that our version of Python is compatible    with the demonstration we've about to do.    So this notebook was written for Python 3.7    and let's just check the version we are running here.    So I'll say import sys and then    I'll just print the sys version.    Run that and okay, cool.    So we are at 3.7.    So next let's go ahead and import    Beautiful Soup into this environment.    So we will say from BS4 import Beautiful Soup, and run that.    Now we have our Beautiful Soup library    imported into our IPython environment.    Now in this demonstration I'm going to show you    how to work with NavigatableString objects.    NavigatableString objects are used as containers    for chunks of text that are stored inside of tags.    So let's just go back to our example    from 6.1 with the soup object.    We'll create a variable here called soup_object    and then we will call the Beautiful Soup    constructor and let's pass an H1 tag.    So we'll create a string and the open tag    is going to be H1 attribute_1=\"heading level 1\"    and then it's going to read the Future Trends in IOT in 2018.    Future trends in IOT in 2018 and then    we will just close this H1 tag.    Okay.    Okay so it looks like I put a quote there    which I didn't need to put so I need to remove that,    and then we have two quotes there    so clean this up a little bit.    Now we want this to be read in as LXML    so let's just pass a parameter that says that.    LXML, okay, and then I'll just double check my syntax    and everything that I've typed out here.    Now let's create and object called tag    and assign it the name H1.    So to do that we'll just say tag is equal to soup_object.H1,    and then let's call the type method    on the tag object to verify that we have    actually indeed created a tag object.    So we'll say type and then pass in    our tag object and run this, and okay,    so you can see that we have indeed created a tag object here    and so let's verify the name of that tag.    It should be H1 so I'll just write tag.name and run that    and yes it is indeed H1 so we have an H1 tag,    but if you just wanted to isolate this string object    from within this tag object then what you can do    is you just say tag.string and it'll print out the string.    Cool, so here we have it, that's our string    from within this tag, so it's right there.    I want to show you here how actually tag.string    is a separate object of it's own.    So let's go ahead and just go to type function    and then pass in tag.string, and when we run this    we see that tag.string is actually a NavigatableString.    So let's play with this a little bit.    I will create a new variable and let's call it    our_navigatable_string and all sides are equal    to tag.string and then print it out.    I'll just copy this and run that.    So basically what this is saying is that our    NavigatableString is now this Future Trends in IOT in 2018.    If you wanted to replace the string object    from within the NavigatableString    you can just call the replace with method    off of the NavigatableString and then    pass in a replacement string.    So let's try that out and we will just replace    this Future Trends for IOT in 2018 with NaN.    So let's just try this out.    We're going to say our navigatable string    and call the replace_with method    and we will pass in Not a Number, so NaN    and then just print our string again.    So we will then say tag.string and see what it prints out,    and as you can see now our string is just not a number.    We have replaced this Future Trends    in IOT with Not a Number.    Okay, now let's look at how to utilize NavigatableStrings.    So I'm giving you this HTML document    and this is going to come preloaded in your Jupyter notebook    just because it's easier for us    to use for demonstration purposes,    and what we're going to do is we're    going to convert this to a parse tree    like we did in the previous section.    So right now I'll just run this cell.    If there is one or more string object    within a parse tree you can easily isolate them.    One way to do that is by calling    the stripped strings generator    to return all of the strings within the object    where string is consisting entirely    of white space are ignored and white space    at the beginning and end of the strings is removed.    So for this example, for each string object    in the parse tree this stripped strings generator    passes through, strips white spaces,    and then prints out each string    that contains a printable representation.    So let's just try this out here.    We'll say for string in our soup object,    we'll call stripped strings and then    for each of these stripped strings    let's just print out a representation of that string.    So put a colon, new line I'm going to say    call it print function, and we want to print    a representation of the string.    So we'll just write REPR and then    pass in the string and then run this.    All right, so now you can see that our strings    have been pretty much cleaned up.    We just have a list of strings here without the tags    or any of the mark up within the body    of this series of strings.    The last thing I want to show you in this demonstration    is how to access parent tag objects within a parse tree.    So let's create a new object called first_link    and then we'll just set it equal to    the A tag from within the parse tree.    First link is equal to our_soup_object.a,    okay and then we'll print out our first link.    Okay cool, so this is actually the first link    in our document and the text that it contains.    So in out document it would be this text here    is actually clickable and it redirects to a bit.ly link,    and if we wanted to access the parent of that first link    we could just say first link, first_link.parent,    and we see that we now have the    parent tag of this first link.    Now the NavigatableString object of first link    is a string that reads last month    Ericsson Digital invited me.    Let me show you.    We will say first_link and then we're just going to    look for the string, so we're going to take that string,    we run that, and we're basically going into this link    and pulling only the string from within it, right.    So that is now printed out as the string object,    and lastly we can also retrieve    the parent of that NavigatableString object.    To do that we would just say first_link.string.parent    and run that.    So in this case the parent of the NavigatableString    is the A tag which is sort of self evident, right.    So now that you know how to work    with objects in Beautiful Soup    we're going to go into using Beautiful Soup for data parsing.    "}

                 - [Teacher] Now that we've finished with tag objects    let's start looking at the NavigatableString object.    The first thing we want to do is make sure    that you have installed Beautiful Soup    and you would do that through the Anaconda command line.    I showed you how to do that in section 6.1.    So in this case we have already installed Beautiful Soup    and then we just want to check to make sure    that our version of Python is compatible    with the demonstration we've about to do.    So this notebook was written for Python 3.7    and let's just check the version we are running here.    So I'll say import sys and then    I'll just print the sys version.    Run that and okay, cool.    So we are at 3.7.    So next let's go ahead and import    Beautiful Soup into this environment.    So we will say from BS4 import Beautiful Soup, and run that.    Now we have our Beautiful Soup library    imported into our IPython environment.    Now in this demonstration I'm going to show you    how to work with NavigatableString objects.    NavigatableString objects are used as containers    for chunks of text that are stored inside of tags.    So let's just go back to our example    from 6.1 with the soup object.    We'll create a variable here called soup_object    and then we will call the Beautiful Soup    constructor and let's pass an H1 tag.    So we'll create a string and the open tag    is going to be H1 attribute_1="heading level 1"    and then it's going to read the Future Trends in IOT in 2018.    Future trends in IOT in 2018 and then    we will just close this H1 tag.    Okay.    Okay so it looks like I put a quote there    which I didn't need to put so I need to remove that,    and then we have two quotes there    so clean this up a little bit.    Now we want this to be read in as LXML    so let's just pass a parameter that says that.    LXML, okay, and then I'll just double check my syntax    and everything that I've typed out here.    Now let's create and object called tag    and assign it the name H1.    So to do that we'll just say tag is equal to soup_object.H1,    and then let's call the type method    on the tag object to verify that we have    actually indeed created a tag object.    So we'll say type and then pass in    our tag object and run this, and okay,    so you can see that we have indeed created a tag object here    and so let's verify the name of that tag.    It should be H1 so I'll just write tag.name and run that    and yes it is indeed H1 so we have an H1 tag,    but if you just wanted to isolate this string object    from within this tag object then what you can do    is you just say tag.string and it'll print out the string.    Cool, so here we have it, that's our string    from within this tag, so it's right there.    I want to show you here how actually tag.string    is a separate object of it's own.    So let's go ahead and just go to type function    and then pass in tag.string, and when we run this    we see that tag.string is actually a NavigatableString.    So let's play with this a little bit.    I will create a new variable and let's call it    our_navigatable_string and all sides are equal    to tag.string and then print it out.    I'll just copy this and run that.    So basically what this is saying is that our    NavigatableString is now this Future Trends in IOT in 2018.    If you wanted to replace the string object    from within the NavigatableString    you can just call the replace with method    off of the NavigatableString and then    pass in a replacement string.    So let's try that out and we will just replace    this Future Trends for IOT in 2018 with NaN.    So let's just try this out.    We're going to say our navigatable string    and call the replace_with method    and we will pass in Not a Number, so NaN    and then just print our string again.    So we will then say tag.string and see what it prints out,    and as you can see now our string is just not a number.    We have replaced this Future Trends    in IOT with Not a Number.    Okay, now let's look at how to utilize NavigatableStrings.    So I'm giving you this HTML document    and this is going to come preloaded in your Jupyter notebook    just because it's easier for us    to use for demonstration purposes,    and what we're going to do is we're    going to convert this to a parse tree    like we did in the previous section.    So right now I'll just run this cell.    If there is one or more string object    within a parse tree you can easily isolate them.    One way to do that is by calling    the stripped strings generator    to return all of the strings within the object    where string is consisting entirely    of white space are ignored and white space    at the beginning and end of the strings is removed.    So for this example, for each string object    in the parse tree this stripped strings generator    passes through, strips white spaces,    and then prints out each string    that contains a printable representation.    So let's just try this out here.    We'll say for string in our soup object,    we'll call stripped strings and then    for each of these stripped strings    let's just print out a representation of that string.    So put a colon, new line I'm going to say    call it print function, and we want to print    a representation of the string.    So we'll just write REPR and then    pass in the string and then run this.    All right, so now you can see that our strings    have been pretty much cleaned up.    We just have a list of strings here without the tags    or any of the mark up within the body    of this series of strings.    The last thing I want to show you in this demonstration    is how to access parent tag objects within a parse tree.    So let's create a new object called first_link    and then we'll just set it equal to    the A tag from within the parse tree.    First link is equal to our_soup_object.a,    okay and then we'll print out our first link.    Okay cool, so this is actually the first link    in our document and the text that it contains.    So in out document it would be this text here    is actually clickable and it redirects to a bit.ly link,    and if we wanted to access the parent of that first link    we could just say first link, first_link.parent,    and we see that we now have the    parent tag of this first link.    Now the NavigatableString object of first link    is a string that reads last month    Ericsson Digital invited me.    Let me show you.    We will say first_link and then we're just going to    look for the string, so we're going to take that string,    we run that, and we're basically going into this link    and pulling only the string from within it, right.    So that is now printed out as the string object,    and lastly we can also retrieve    the parent of that NavigatableString object.    To do that we would just say first_link.string.parent    and run that.    So in this case the parent of the NavigatableString    is the A tag which is sort of self evident, right.    So now that you know how to work    with objects in Beautiful Soup    we're going to go into using Beautiful Soup for data parsing.
