# A1c.ipynb

## Plot data from 12 years' Hgb-A1c readings;
create Scikit-learn models and show their predictions.

## Requirements:
* The libraries `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and my module `date_time_string.py` (included)

## Usage:
* Move module `date_time_string.py` to a location in your `$PYTHONPATH`.
* Run the included Jupyter notebook `A1c.ipynb` in a browser window. Make sure the data file `A1c-data.csv`is in the same folder as `A1c.ipynb`.
* The program will save a PNG image of the resulting plots.
