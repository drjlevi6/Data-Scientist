# predictive\_accuracy\_and\_dataset\_size

Calculate accuracy of a Scikit-learn model applied to datasets with varying  numbers of samples.

## Usage
The project consists of a single Jupyter notebook. No additional files are needed. 

Run the notebook in your browser of choice. A noisy dataset is displayed, an estimator is created and fitted on subsets, of varying size, on the original dataset. The predictive accuracy of the model on the various subsets is calculated and plotted.
