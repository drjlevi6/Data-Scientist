# Machine-Learning-Unsupervised-Recolor-Image
Use Scikit-learn's unsupervised learning function `KMeans` to redraw a multicolor file with just two colors, dark and light.

## Package Contains:
* a Jupyter notebook, `RGB_Cluster_Analysis.ipynb`
* two Python modules, `date_time_string.py` and `save_figure_per_user.py` used by the Jupyter nobook
* a multicolor image file, `function-fx-drawing.png`, used as imput by the Jupyter notebook
* the two-color output of the notebook, `Fig-4-function-fx-recolored-<date>-<time>.png`
* image files `Fig-...png` created by the notebook
* this README file

## To Run the Notebook:
* Move `RGB_Cluster_Analysis.ipynb` and `date_time_string.py` to a folder in your `$PYTHONPATH`
* Change the path in
